//: ### Start Here
//: Type your **first** and **last** name below


//: ### Question 1
//: Why are strings in Swift *not* indexed (subscripted) with integer values?


//: ### Question 2
//: Give an example of checking to see if a string starts with another string.


//: ### Question 3
//: Give an example of declaring an array of Ints using **initializer syntax**.


//: ### Question 4
//: Use the array you declared in question 3 and assign to it the values 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 using an **array literal**.


//: ### Question 5
//: Use the same array from question 4 and insert the value 4 in between 3 and 5.


//: ### Question 6
//: Use for-in to iterate over each value in your array of Ints and print them out.

//: ### Question 7
//: Give an example of declaring a dictionary that has an Int key and String value using **initializer syntax**

//: ### Question 8
//: Fix the error(s) in the following switch statement, and add the remaining values up to "9", "nine", "Nine"
var justAnInt:Int
var n:String = "8"
switch n {
case "1", "one", "One":
    justAnInt = 1
case "2", "two", "Two":
    justAnInt = 2
case "3", "three", "Three":
    justAnInt = 3
case "4", "four", "Four":
    justAnInt = 4
case "5", "five", "Five":
    justAnInt = 5
}


//: ### Question 9
//: Use the dictionary from question 7 and the loop below to add keys of 0 through 9 with their matching string as the value "0" through "9".
for n in 0...9 {
    // Your code here
}

//: ### Question 10
//: Create a for-in loop that iterates over the elements in your dictionary and print out each key and value **on a separate line**

//: ### Bonus Question
//: What is source control and why would you want to use it?
